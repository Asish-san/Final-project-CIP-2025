"""
 This program is designed to blend simple IQ exercises with guided
 emotional reflection and mindfulness techniques, aiming to bring
 calmness, awareness, and clarity to users in just a few minutes.
"""
"""
 It starts by welcoming the user warmly and slowly transitions
 through the following steps:
"""
#   1. A light IQ warm-up to engage mental alertness.
#   2. An emotional check-in where users express how they feel.
#   3. A reflective mirror that provides insight and a quote.
#   4. Mood-specific techniques to promote calmness or joy.
#   5. A visual break with calming ASCII scenes and quotes.
#   6. Optional journaling to reflect and store personal thoughts.
#   7. Collects feedback to evaluate user satisfaction.
#   8. Closes with warmth and displays saved journal entries.

# ðŸ“Œ Why is this important?
""" 
 In our fast-paced world, individuals often lack the space to pause
 and reflect. This app acts like a digital mental pause buttonâ€”
 offering relaxation, a sense of being heard, and helpful coping
 suggestionsâ€”all in a few mindful minutes.
"""
